### Memory Footprint (Workers)

From `BenchmarkEstimateMemory500kWorkers-32` logs:

- Estimated memory at 500k workers:
  - `heapAlloc=2.34 GiB`
  - `heapInuse=2.36 GiB`
  - `alloc≈4.90 KiB/worker`
  - `inuse≈4.96 KiB/worker`

## Estimated Max Miners on This CPU

Using the benchmark's built-in conversion at **15 shares/min per miner**:

- Conservative (70% headroom, lower measured path): **~3.08 million miners**
- Practical target from full submit+process path (70% headroom): **~5.09 million miners**
- Peak benchmark-only ceiling (no headroom): **~7.46 million miners**

## Estimated Network Bandwidth (1GbE vs 10GbE)

Assumptions used for share traffic sizing:

- Submit request sample size from `miner_decode_bench_test.go`: **100 bytes** (including newline)
- Successful submit response (`{"id":1,"result":true,"error":null}\n`): **36 bytes**
- Total application payload per accepted share round trip: **136 bytes/share**
- Protocol overhead factor (TCP/IP/Ethernet framing, ACKs, etc.): **1.2x**
- Share rate used by capacity benchmarks: **15 shares/min per miner** (`0.25 shares/s`)

Derived per-miner bandwidth:

- `0.25 * 136 * 8 * 1.2 = 326.4 bps` per miner

Estimated max miners by link speed (assuming ~94% usable line rate):

- **1GbE (~940 Mbps usable): ~2,879,902 miners @ 15 spm**
- **10GbE (~9.4 Gbps usable): ~28,799,020 miners @ 15 spm**

Bandwidth needed for the CPU-based miner estimates above:

- Conservative CPU estimate (~3.08M miners): **~1.01 Gbps**
- Practical CPU estimate (~5.09M miners): **~1.66 Gbps**
- Peak benchmark-only CPU ceiling (~7.46M miners): **~2.43 Gbps**

Implication:

- With a **1GbE** NIC, networking is the bottleneck before the practical CPU limit.
- With a **10GbE** NIC, CPU/system overhead becomes the bottleneck first (for these measured paths).

## Recommendation

For capacity planning on this host CPU, use **~5.0 million miners @ 15 shares/min** as a practical CPU estimate, and **~3.0 million** as a stricter conservative floor when reserving more operational safety margin.

## Notes

- These are microbenchmarks and synthetic in-process paths.
- Real deployments will be lower due to network I/O, TLS, kernel scheduling, RPC/back-end dependencies, DB/fs activity, GC pressure, and mixed traffic patterns.
- If needed, rerun with `-count=5` and compare via `benchstat` for tighter confidence intervals.
